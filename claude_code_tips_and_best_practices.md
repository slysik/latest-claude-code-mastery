## Memory Management and Performance

### Critical Memory Considerations
- **Auto-compact Issues**: Monitor for infinite context consumption loops
  - Symptoms: Excessive API usage and slow responses
  - Solution: Configure appropriate memory limits and monitoring
- **Context Management**: Regularly review and clear context when necessary
  - Best Practice: Implement context rotation for long sessions
  - Monitoring: Track memory usage patterns and optimize

### Performance Optimization
- Set up usage monitoring under Anthropic Pro subscription
- Usage limits reset every 5 hours - plan accordingly
- Monitor consumption to avoid unexpected service interruptions
- Implement efficient prompting strategies to reduce token usage

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Problems
- **Issue**: API key configuration failures
- **Solution**: Use environment variables for secure key management
- **Best Practice**: Implement proper key rotation and access controls

### Platform-Specific Challenges
- **macOS/Windows/Linux**: Different configuration requirements
- **Solution**: Follow platform-specific setup documentation
- **Best Practice**: Test on target deployment platforms early in development

### Memory and Context Issues
- **Issue**: Context loops and excessive memory consumption
- **Solution**: Configure memory management settings appropriately
- **Best Practice**: Monitor context usage and implement cleanup strategies

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- Usage feedback stored for only 30 days
- No use of feedback data for model training
- Limited access to user session data
- Clear privacy policies and data handling procedures

### Enterprise Security
- Implement proper API key management and rotation
- Use corporate proxy configurations for secure access
- Monitor usage patterns for security compliance
- Establish team-specific security protocols
