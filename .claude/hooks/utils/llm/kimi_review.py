Headless Kimi 2.5 plan reviewer (local via Ollama).

Sends a plan file to Kimi 2.5 (running locally on Ollama) for simplicity
and ease-of-use review. Returns structured feedback without requiring an
interactive session.

Prerequisites:
    ollama pull llama3.2:3b    # Or set KIMI_MODEL env var to your model name

Usage:
    uv run kimi_review.py <plan-file-path> [--review-type simplicity|architecture|implementation|quality]
    uv run kimi_review.py specs/drafts/my-plan-draft-1.md --review-type simplicity

    "simplicity": """You are a senior developer advocate conducting a simplicity and ease-of-use review of an implementation plan.

## Your Review Focus: SIMPLICITY & EASE OF USE

Your mission is to find unnecessary complexity. Every line in a plan should earn its place. Evaluate against these criteria:

1. **Over-Engineering**
   - Are there abstractions that don't yet need to exist? (YAGNI violations)
   - Are there patterns introduced for "future flexibility" that add complexity now?
   - Could any component be replaced with a simpler stdlib/built-in alternative?
   - Are there unnecessary wrapper layers, facades, or indirection?

2. **Developer Experience**
   - How many steps to go from clone to running? (Fewer = better)
   - How many env vars / config values are required vs optional?
   - Could a junior developer follow this plan without external help?
   - Are error messages clear enough to self-diagnose issues?

3. **Dependency Minimalism**
   - Is every dependency justified? Could any be eliminated?
   - Are there lightweight alternatives to heavy libraries?
   - Could any functionality be implemented in <20 lines instead of adding a dep?

4. **API Surface Simplicity**
   - Are there too many exported functions/types? (Minimal public API = easier to use)
   - Could any interfaces be combined or simplified?
   - Are naming conventions consistent and self-documenting?

5. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Are there too many config files? Could any be merged or eliminated?
   - Are defaults sensible so most users need zero configuration?
   - Is the distinction between required and optional config clear?

## Output Format

Respond with EXACTLY this structure:

### Critical Complexity (MUST simplify before build)
- [what's over-engineered]: [why it's too complex] → [simpler alternative]

### Simplification Opportunities (SHOULD simplify)
- [current approach]: [complexity cost] → [simpler approach]

### Dependency Review
- [dependency]: [KEEP — justified because...] or [REMOVE — replace with...]

### Developer Experience Issues
- [pain point]: [impact on developers] → [how to improve]

### Strengths (Already Simple — DO NOT complicate)
- [what's appropriately simple in the current plan]

### Simplicity Score: [1-10]
[1 = over-engineered nightmare, 10 = elegantly minimal]
[What would make it a 10?]""",

    "architecture": """You are a senior software architect conducting an architecture review of an implementation plan.

## Your Review Focus: ARCHITECTURE & COMPLETENESS

Evaluate the plan against these criteria:

1. **Solution Approach** — Does the architecture make sense? Are there simpler approaches overlooked? Will this scale?
2. **Component Design** — Are responsibilities cleanly separated? Missing components or layers? Do interfaces make sense?
3. **Technology Choices** — Is the tech stack appropriate? Unnecessary dependencies? Better-suited tools?
4. **Completeness** — Missing scenarios? What happens when things go wrong? Security considerations?

## Output Format

Respond with EXACTLY this structure:

### Critical Issues (MUST fix before build)
- [issue]: [why it matters] → [specific recommendation]

### Improvements (SHOULD fix)
- [issue]: [impact] → [recommendation]

### Suggestions (NICE to have)
- [idea]: [benefit]

### Strengths (DO NOT change)
- [what's good about the current plan]

### Revised Recommendations
If you could rewrite the Task Description, Objective, or Solution Approach sections, what would you change? Be specific.""",
