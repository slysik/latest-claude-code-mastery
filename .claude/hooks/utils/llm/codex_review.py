Headless Codex plan reviewer.

Sends a plan file to codex-mini-latest (via Responses API) for senior architecture review.
Returns structured feedback without requiring an interactive session.

Usage:
    uv run codex_review.py <plan-file-path> [--review-type architecture|implementation|quality]
    uv run codex_review.py specs/drafts/my-plan-draft-1.md --review-type architecture

## Your Review Focus: ARCHITECTURE & COMPLETENESS

Evaluate the plan against these criteria:

1. **Solution Approach** — Does the architecture make sense? Are there simpler approaches overlooked? Will this scale?
2. **Component Design** — Are responsibilities cleanly separated? Missing components or layers? Do interfaces make sense?
3. **Technology Choices** — Is the tech stack appropriate? Unnecessary dependencies? Better-suited tools?
4. **Completeness** — Missing scenarios? What happens when things go wrong? Security considerations?

## Output Format

Respond with EXACTLY this structure:

### Critical Issues (MUST fix before build)
- [issue]: [why it matters] → [specific recommendation]

### Improvements (SHOULD fix)
- [issue]: [impact] → [recommendation]

### Suggestions (NICE to have)
- [idea]: [benefit]

### Strengths (DO NOT change)
- [what's good about the current plan]

### Revised Recommendations
If you could rewrite the Task Description, Objective, or Solution Approach sections, what would you change? Be specific.""",

    "implementation": """You are a senior engineer conducting an implementation feasibility review.

## Your Review Focus: IMPLEMENTATION FEASIBILITY & EDGE CASES

Evaluate whether this plan can actually be BUILT successfully:

1. **Task Decomposition** — Right size? Can each worker complete independently? Hidden dependencies?
2. **Step-by-Step Accuracy** — Could a developer follow these steps? File paths correct? Signatures specified?
3. **Edge Cases** — What inputs could break this? Concurrent access? Empty state? Corrupt data?
4. **Worker Context** — Does each worker have enough context? Implicit assumptions?
5. **Parallel Opportunities** — Sequential tasks that could be parallel? Parallel tasks with hidden deps?

## Output Format

### Critical Issues (MUST fix)
- [task ID]: [issue] → [specific fix]

### Implementation Gaps
- [gap]: [what's missing] → [what to add]

### Edge Cases to Handle
- [scenario]: [what happens] → [how to handle it]

### Task Adjustments
- [task ID]: [current problem] → [revised approach]""",

    "quality": """You are a QA lead conducting a final quality gate review.

## Your Review Focus: IS THIS PLAN BUILD-READY?

1. **Acceptance Criteria** — Specific and measurable? Verifiable with a single command? Missing criteria?
2. **Validation Commands** — Will each command work? Cover all criteria? Any gaps?
3. **Team Orchestration** — Optimal assignments? Correct dependency graph? Better parallelization?
4. **Clarity** — Could a developer with no context follow this? Ambiguous instructions?
5. **Risk** — Most likely failure point? What causes restart? Mitigation strategies?

## Output Format

### VERDICT: PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL

### Blocking Issues (if FAIL or CONDITIONAL)
- [issue]: [why it blocks] → [fix required]

### Risk Register
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|

### Confidence Score: [1-10]
