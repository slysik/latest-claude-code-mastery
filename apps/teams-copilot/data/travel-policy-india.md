## 1. Visa Requirements

All Gates Foundation staff and consultants traveling to India for official business must obtain appropriate visa documentation prior to departure. The Foundation does not support tourist visas for business travel.

### Visa Categories

**US Citizens**: Apply for an e-Business Visa (eBUSINESS VISA) for all Foundation-related activities. This visa provides multiple entry privileges valid for one year from the date of issue, with a maximum stay of 180 days per visit.

**Non-US Citizens**: Visa requirements vary by nationality. Contact the Foundation Travel Department at travel@gatesfoundation.org for guidance specific to your passport country. Processing times may be significantly longer for some nationalities.

### Application Process

1. Apply online at the official portal: indianvisaonline.gov.in
2. Standard processing time is 3-5 business days; expedited service is available for an additional fee
3. Your passport must have at least 6 months of validity remaining from your planned date of entry
4. Your passport must contain at least 2 blank visa pages for entry/exit stamps
5. Upload a recent passport-style photograph meeting Indian government specifications
6. Provide Foundation letter of invitation if requested (available from Delhi office)

### Timeline and Fees

**Minimum Application Window**: Apply at least 3 weeks before your planned travel date to allow for processing delays, technical issues, or required corrections.

**Visa Fees**: The Foundation does NOT reimburse visa application fees or passport renewal costs. Employees are responsible for maintaining valid passports and bearing visa costs as a condition of international travel assignments.

**Emergency Travel**: If urgent travel is required with less than 3 weeks notice, contact the Foundation Travel Department immediately. Emergency processing may be available but is not guaranteed.

### Important Notes

## 2. Health & Vaccinations

India presents specific health risks that require advance preparation. All travelers must consult a qualified travel medicine provider 4-6 weeks before departure to allow sufficient time for multi-dose vaccine series and medication pre-loading.

### Required Vaccinations

The following vaccinations are **mandatory** for all Foundation travelers to India:

- **Hepatitis A**: 2-dose series (initial dose, booster at 6-12 months)
- **Hepatitis B**: 3-dose series (0, 1, and 6 months) or accelerated schedule
- **COVID-19**: Current primary series plus most recent booster dose as recommended by CDC
- **MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)**: 2 doses, or documented immunity

Proof of vaccination must be uploaded to your Foundation health record in Workday at least 10 business days before departure. Travelers who cannot provide proof of required vaccinations will have travel authorization revoked.

### Recommended Vaccinations

The following vaccines are **strongly recommended**, particularly for field visits outside major metropolitan areas:

- **Typhoid**: Single-dose injection (valid 2 years) or 4-dose oral series (valid 5 years)
- **Japanese Encephalitis**: 2-dose series, recommended for rural travel during monsoon season
- **Rabies**: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (3 doses over 21-28 days) recommended for field staff with animal contact risk

### Malaria Prevention

Malaria transmission occurs in most rural areas and some urban areas throughout India. **Malaria prophylaxis is mandatory** for travel outside Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and other major cities above 2,000 meters elevation.

**Approved Prophylaxis Options**:
- Atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone): Daily dosing, start 1-2 days before travel
- Doxycycline: Daily dosing, start 1-2 days before travel
- Mefloquine (Lariam): Weekly dosing, start 2 weeks before travel

Consult your travel medicine provider to select the most appropriate option based on your medical history, itinerary, and drug resistance patterns.

### Medical Kit

All travelers must carry a personal medical kit containing:
- Prescription medications in original packaging with pharmacy labels
- Written prescription documentation for controlled substances
- Anti-diarrheal medication (loperamide)
- Oral rehydration salts
- Broad-spectrum antibiotic (ciprofloxacin or azithromycin) as prescribed
- Insect repellent containing 20-30% DEET
- Hand sanitizer (alcohol-based, 60%+ concentration)
- Basic first aid supplies (adhesive bandages, gauze, tape, antiseptic wipes)

### Food and Water Safety

- Drink only bottled water from sealed containers; avoid ice in beverages
- Avoid raw or undercooked foods, including salads and unpeeled fruits
- Choose hot, freshly prepared foods from reputable establishments
- Avoid street food vendors unless approved by Delhi office staff
- Use hand sanitizer before all meals

### Travel Insurance

All international travelers are automatically covered under the Foundation's group travel insurance policy. Carry your insurance card (available in Workday) at all times. The policy includes emergency medical evacuation, which may be utilized in consultation with the Foundation Security Operations Center.

## 3. Per Diem Rates (Effective January 1, 2026)

The Foundation follows US State Department Standardized Regulations (DSSR 925) for foreign per diem rates in India. Rates are updated quarterly; always verify current rates in Concur before travel.

### Daily Allowance Rates by Location

| Location | Lodging (USD/day) | M&IE (USD/day) | Total Per Diem |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| New Delhi | $233 | $120 | $353 |
| Mumbai | $245 | $125 | $370 |
| Bangalore | $280 | $135 | $415 |
| Kolkata | $195 | $105 | $300 |
| Chennai | $210 | $110 | $320 |
| Hyderabad | $225 | $115 | $340 |
| Patna (Bihar) | $165 | $95 | $260 |
| Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) | $175 | $98 | $273 |
| Rural/Field Locations | $120 | $85 | $205 |

### M&IE Breakdown (Meals and Incidental Expenses)

M&IE rates cover all meals and incidental expenses during your stay:
- **Breakfast**: 20% of M&IE rate
- **Lunch**: 35% of M&IE rate
- **Dinner**: 35% of M&IE rate
- **Incidentals**: 10% of M&IE rate (tips, laundry for trips >5 days, local phone calls)

### Per Diem Calculation Rules

**First and Last Day of Travel**: You receive 75% of the applicable M&IE rate on travel days. Full lodging per diem applies if overnight stay is required.

**Meals Provided**: If meals are included in your hotel rate, provided at meetings, or covered by Foundation program partners, you must deduct the proportional meal cost from your per diem claim (see M&IE breakdown percentages above).

**Lodging Reimbursement**: Actual lodging expenses are reimbursed up to the maximum daily lodging rate. You must provide itemized hotel folios (receipts) for all lodging expenses. Credit card statements are not acceptable documentation.

**Location Classification**: If your itinerary includes multiple locations in one day, use the per diem rate for the location where you spend the night. For field visits without overnight stay, use the rate for your lodging location.

### Extended Stay Adjustments

For continuous stays in the same location exceeding 30 days, lodging per diem is reduced by 10% for days 31-60, and 15% for days 61+. Contact the Travel Department if your assignment requires extended stay.

## 4. Approved Accommodations

To ensure safety, security, and cost-effectiveness, the Foundation maintains a list of approved hotel chains and properties in India. All lodging must be booked through the Foundation Travel Department.

### Foundation-Approved Hotel Chains

The following hotel chains meet Foundation security and quality standards:

- **Taj Hotels** (Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces): Luxury tier
- **The Oberoi Group** (Oberoi, Trident): Luxury tier
- **JW Marriott**: Premium tier
- **ITC Hotels** (ITC Hotels, WelcomHotel): Premium tier
- **Courtyard by Marriott**: Business tier
- **Fortune Hotels** (ITC subsidiary): Business tier
- **Lemon Tree Hotels**: Business tier
- **Park Plaza**: Business tier

### Booking Procedures

**All lodging must be booked exclusively through the Foundation Travel Department**: travel@gatesfoundation.org or via the Concur Travel portal. Direct bookings with hotels are not permitted and will not be reimbursed unless pre-approved in writing by your Senior Director.

**Booking Timeline**: Submit accommodation requests at least 15 business days before travel. Late requests may result in limited availability or higher rates.

**Room Selection**: Book standard single occupancy rooms. Suite upgrades require VP-level approval and must be justified by business necessity (e.g., hosting program partner meetings).

**Hotel Folios Required**: At checkout, request and retain a detailed, itemized hotel folio showing all charges. Credit card statements are not acceptable for reimbursement. Folios must be uploaded to Concur with your expense report.

### Pre/Post Travel Accommodation

The Foundation will cover up to **2 nights** of accommodation before or after official business travel to allow for jet lag adjustment and time zone acclimation. This is particularly important for India travel given the 10.5 to 13.5 hour time difference from US time zones.

Pre/post travel nights must be:
- At the same hotel where business stay occurs
- Booked through Foundation Travel Department
- Clearly identified as pre/post travel in your trip justification
- Limited to 2 total nights (1 pre + 1 post, or 2 pre, or 2 post)

### Rural and Field Accommodations

For field visits to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and other rural program states, standard hotel chains may not be available. In these cases:

1. **Foundation-Arranged Guesthouses**: The Delhi office maintains relationships with vetted guesthouses in key field locations. These are pre-approved and must be requested through the Delhi office.

2. **Local Partner Hotels**: If Foundation guesthouses are unavailable, the Delhi office will identify and pre-approve local hotels that meet minimum safety standards.

3. **Security Protocols**: Never book rural accommodations independently. All field lodging must be arranged by the Delhi office at least 2 weeks in advance.

4. **Modified Per Diem**: Rural field locations follow the $120 lodging / $85 M&IE per diem rate as listed in Section 3.

### Loyalty Programs

You may enroll in hotel loyalty programs and retain points earned during Foundation travel. However, you may not select hotels or make booking decisions based on personal loyalty program benefits. Foundation policies and approved properties take precedence.

## 5. Ground Transportation

Safe, reliable ground transportation is essential for Foundation operations in India. All transportation arrangements must prioritize safety and security while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

### Inter-City Transportation

**Car Service**: For inter-city ground travel (e.g., Delhi to Agra, Mumbai to Pune), use pre-arranged car service through the Foundation Travel Department. Self-drive rental cars are prohibited in India due to safety and liability concerns.

**Domestic Flights**: Economy class is the standard for all domestic flights within India. Book through the Foundation Concur portal. Business class for domestic flights requires Senior Director approval and is typically approved only for medical reasons or flights exceeding 4 hours.

**Rail Travel**: Indian Railways is approved for long-distance travel with the following class restrictions:
- **Overnight journeys**: AC First Class (1A) or AC 2-Tier (2A) only
- **Day journeys**: AC Chair Car (CC) or AC 3-Tier (3A) acceptable
- Book through the Foundation Travel Department or authorized travel agents who can navigate the Indian Railways booking system
- Avoid general/unreserved compartments for safety reasons

### Urban Transportation

**Ride-Hailing Services**: Uber and Ola (India's leading ride-hailing platform) are approved for urban transportation in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai, and Hyderabad.

**Documentation Requirements**: Save electronic receipts from all Uber/Ola rides. Screenshots of trip details are acceptable if automated receipts are not available. Receipts must show pickup/drop-off locations, distance, and fare.

**Safety Protocols**:
- Always verify the vehicle license plate and driver photo before entering
- Share ride details with colleagues using the in-app feature
- Sit in the back seat
- Avoid ride-sharing options (use private rides only)

**Auto-Rickshaws and Taxis**: Metered auto-rickshaws and prepaid taxis from official airport/rail counters are acceptable for short trips. Always insist on meter use or prepaid vouchers; negotiate fares in advance if meters are "not working."

### Field Visit Transportation

**Foundation-Approved Drivers**: For all rural field visits to program sites, use Foundation-approved drivers arranged through the Delhi office. These drivers:
- Have been background-checked and security-vetted
- Know Foundation protocols and emergency procedures
- Are familiar with local road conditions and safety issues
- Can provide translation assistance if needed

**Never hire vehicles independently** for field visits. Independent arrangements pose significant safety and liability risks.

### Safety Protocols for Women Travelers

Women traveling in India should observe additional transportation safety protocols:

- **Avoid public transportation after dark**: This includes buses, trains, and metro systems after 8:00 PM
- **Use verified transport services only**: Stick to Uber/Ola or Foundation-arranged vehicles
- **Share itinerary**: Inform colleagues of your transportation plans and estimated arrival times
- **Dress modestly**: Conservative dress reduces unwanted attention in public spaces
- **Sit in back seat**: Always sit in the back seat of taxis and ride-hailing vehicles
- **Trust your instincts**: If a situation feels unsafe, exit the vehicle in a public, well-lit area

### Transportation Reimbursement

Transportation expenses are reimbursed with proper documentation:
- **Flights**: Boarding passes and itinerary receipts required
- **Ride-hailing**: Electronic receipts from app
- **Taxis/auto-rickshaws**: Paper receipts (if available) or expense note with details
- **Rail**: Ticket and reservation documentation

Personal vehicle use is generally not applicable in India but would be reimbursed at the IRS standard mileage rate ($0.70/mile for 2026) if exceptionally approved.

## 6. Safety & Security

India is currently classified as **Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution** by the US Department of State. While millions of travelers visit India safely each year, Foundation staff must remain vigilant and follow established security protocols.

### Pre-Departure Requirements

**STEP Registration**: All US citizen travelers must register with the US Department of State's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) at step.state.gov before departure. STEP registration:
- Enables the US Embassy to contact you in emergencies
- Provides you with important security updates
- Facilitates evacuation assistance if necessary

**Document Security**: Prepare and secure the following documents:
- **Physical copies**: Make 2 photocopies of your passport photo page, visa, return flight ticket, and itinerary
- **Digital copies**: Scan or photograph all documents and store in secure cloud storage (OneDrive/Google Drive)
- **Separate storage**: Keep one physical copy in your checked luggage, one in your day bag (separate from originals), and originals in hotel safe

**Foundation Security Briefing**: First-time travelers to India must complete the mandatory "India Security Awareness" e-learning module in Workday Learning at least 5 business days before departure.

### In-Country Security Protocols

**Situational Awareness**: Remain aware of your surroundings at all times. Avoid distractions such as mobile phone use while walking in crowded areas. Be particularly vigilant at:
- Tourist attractions and religious sites
- Markets and crowded commercial areas
- Transportation hubs (airports, train stations, bus terminals)
- Large public gatherings and festivals

**Solo Travel After Dark**: Avoid traveling alone after dark, especially in unfamiliar areas. If evening work or social obligations require after-dark travel, use Foundation-arranged transportation or verified ride-hailing services (never walk or use public transport).

**Secure Communication**: Do not discuss Foundation program details, funding amounts, partner organizations, or strategic plans in public spaces or with unauthorized individuals. Assume conversations can be overheard. Hotel business centers and public Wi-Fi networks are not secure for Foundation communications.

**Program Discretion**: Maintain a low profile regarding Foundation affiliation. Avoid wearing Foundation-branded clothing or displaying Foundation materials in public. The Foundation's high profile and association with significant funding can make staff targets for scams, theft, or inappropriate solicitations.

### Security Contact Card

The Foundation Security Operations Center will issue you a security contact card before travel. Carry this card at all times and program emergency numbers into your mobile phone. The card includes:
- Foundation Security Operations Center 24/7 number
- Gates Foundation Delhi office contacts
- US Embassy emergency number
- Local emergency services numbers
- International SOS assistance number

### Mandatory Incident Reporting

**Immediately report** any of the following to the Foundation Security Operations Center (+1-206-709-3100):
- Arrest or detention by authorities
- Theft of passport, visa, or Foundation equipment
- Physical assault or threat of violence
- Serious illness or injury requiring hospitalization
- Natural disaster, civil unrest, or terrorist incident in your area
- Any situation that makes you feel unsafe

**Within 24 hours, report**:
- Theft of personal property
- Minor illness or injury
- Harassment or inappropriate conduct
- Lost or damaged Foundation equipment
- Traffic accidents

### Additional Safety Protocols for Women

Women staff members should observe additional precautions while traveling in India:

- **Dress modestly**: Wear conservative clothing that covers shoulders and knees, particularly outside major metropolitan areas. Avoid tight-fitting or revealing clothing.
- **Avoid isolated areas**: Stay in well-populated, well-lit areas. Do not walk alone in parks, beaches, or isolated neighborhoods.
- **Evening activities**: Attend evening meetings and events with colleagues. Avoid solo dining after dark.
- **Accommodations**: Request rooms on floors 3-6 (not ground floor, not above safe evacuation height). Keep door locked and use all security features.
- **Unwanted attention**: If you experience harassment, move to a public, populated area and contact Foundation security if the situation persists.

### Country-Specific Risks

**Regional Instability**: Avoid travel to Jammu and Kashmir (except Ladakh region), areas along the India-Pakistan border, northeastern states experiencing insurgency, and areas affected by Naxalite violence. The Travel Department maintains a current list of restricted areas.

**Civil Unrest**: Political demonstrations, strikes (bandhs), and religious processions can occur with little warning. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, even if they appear peaceful.

**Terrorism**: Terrorist attacks have occurred in India, particularly in major cities and tourist areas. Remain vigilant in crowded locations and report suspicious activity to authorities and Foundation security.

## 7. Cultural Considerations

Understanding and respecting Indian cultural norms is essential for effective Foundation work and building strong partner relationships. India is a culturally diverse country with significant regional variation; these guidelines provide general principles applicable across most contexts.

### Greetings and Introductions

**Traditional Greeting**: "Namaste" (pronounced nah-mah-stay) is the traditional Indian greeting. Place your palms together in front of your chest with fingers pointing upward, accompanied by a slight bow of the head. This gesture is universally appropriate and respectful.

**Business Greetings**: Handshakes are increasingly common in Indian business contexts, particularly in major cities and corporate environments. However, wait for your Indian counterpart to extend their hand first. Some women may prefer not to shake hands with men; if a handshake is not offered, use the namaste greeting.

**Business Cards**: Exchange business cards with both hands or with the right hand only (never left hand). Take a moment to review the card before putting it away; immediately pocketing a card can be perceived as disrespectful. Present your own card with the text facing the recipient.

### Forms of Address

**Titles Matter**: Indians place considerable importance on titles and hierarchical relationships. Address people by their professional titles (Dr., Professor, Mr., Mrs.) followed by their surname until explicitly invited to use first names.

**Academic Credentials**: PhD holders should be addressed as "Dr." in all contexts. Engineers are sometimes addressed as "Engineer [Surname]" in technical contexts.

**Name Order**: Most Indian names follow the Western convention (given name, surname), but some South Indian names follow different conventions. If uncertain, ask politely for clarification on how to address someone.

### Business Attire

**Men**: Conservative business formal is expected for meetings with government officials, partner organizations, and community leaders. Wear long pants (typically dark colored), long-sleeved collared shirts, and closed-toe shoes. Jackets and ties are common for important meetings, though not always required in hot weather.

**Women**: Conservative business attire is essential. Wear clothing that covers shoulders and extends below the knee. Avoid low necklines, tight-fitting clothes, sleeveless tops, and short skirts. Loose-fitting pants or longer skirts with modest tops are appropriate. Consider wearing a dupatta (scarf) for conservative settings. Many women staff find that wearing traditional Indian attire (such as salwar kameez or kurtas) is comfortable and culturally respectful.

**Field Attire**: For rural field visits, even more conservative dress is appropriate. Men should wear long pants and shirts with sleeves. Women should ensure full coverage of arms and legs.

### Meeting Etiquette

**Timeliness**: Arrive on time for meetings, even though meetings may not always start promptly. Indian business culture is becoming more punctual, particularly in corporate settings, but flexibility with timing is still common.

**Relationship Building**: Indians generally prefer to establish personal rapport before diving into business discussions. Expect some time at the beginning of meetings for personal conversation. Rushing directly into business matters can be perceived as impersonal or aggressive.

**Hierarchy**: Show particular deference to senior leaders and elders. In group settings, address questions and comments to senior persons first. Wait for senior team members to speak before offering your perspectives.

**Indirect Communication**: Indian communication style can be more indirect than Western norms. "I'll try" or "We'll see what we can do" may indicate reluctance or inability rather than commitment. Listen carefully for subtle cues and ask clarifying questions politely.

**Decision-Making**: Decisions may take longer than expected, particularly when consensus-building or hierarchical approval is required. Be patient and avoid pressuring partners for immediate answers.

### Dining Etiquette

**Right-Hand Rule**: Use your right hand for eating, giving or receiving items, and gestures. The left hand is traditionally associated with personal hygiene and is considered impure for these purposes.

**Vegetarianism**: Many Indians are vegetarian for religious or cultural reasons. Never assume someone eats meat. When hosting meals, always include substantial vegetarian options and clearly identify which dishes contain meat, eggs, or alcohol.

**Dietary Restrictions**: Be aware of specific dietary practices:
- Many Hindus avoid beef
- Muslims avoid pork and require halal meat
- Jains avoid root vegetables, onions, and garlic
- During religious fasting periods, some colleagues may have modified diets

When organizing group meals, ask participants about dietary preferences and restrictions in advance.

**Alcohol**: Many Indians abstain from alcohol for religious or personal reasons. Never pressure colleagues to drink. Foundation policy prohibits alcohol expenses on Foundation accounts.

### Religious Sensitivity

**Temple/Religious Site Visits**: If visiting religious sites:
- Remove shoes before entering
- Cover your head if required (often in Sikh gurdwaras)
- Dress extremely modestly
- Ask permission before photographing
- Follow all posted rules and guidance from site officials

**Religious Holidays**: India celebrates numerous religious holidays across Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist traditions. Be aware of major holidays that may affect business schedules and government office closures. Your Delhi office colleagues can provide guidance on holiday schedules.

**Avoid Sensitive Topics**: Do not discuss:
- Caste system or caste politics
- India-Pakistan relations
- Religious conflicts or communal tensions
- Internal politics unless you have deep knowledge and strong relationships

### Gender Dynamics

**Professional Context**: Indian women are well-represented in professional settings, government, and NGO sectors. Treat women colleagues with the same professional respect as male colleagues.

**Physical Contact**: Physical contact between men and women is less common in Indian culture than in Western contexts. Avoid hugging, kissing on cheeks, or touching colleagues of the opposite gender beyond handshakes.

**Social Situations**: In more traditional settings, men and women may socialize separately. Follow the lead of your hosts in these situations.

### Gift Giving

Small gifts are appreciated as tokens of respect, particularly when visiting someone's office or home for the first time. Appropriate gifts include:
- High-quality pens or notebooks
- Items representing your home region or the Foundation
- Sweets or dry fruits (in sealed packages)

Avoid:
- Leather products (offensive to Hindus and Jains)
- Alcohol or products containing alcohol
- Beef products
- Overly expensive gifts (may cause discomfort or appear as improper influence)

Present and receive gifts with both hands or right hand only.

## 8. Expense Reporting

Accurate and timely expense reporting is essential for Foundation financial compliance, IRS regulations, and audit requirements. All travelers are responsible for understanding and following expense reporting policies.

### Reporting Timeline

**14-Day Deadline**: Submit ALL travel expenses within **14 calendar days** of your return date. This deadline is strictly enforced to ensure timely financial reporting and to maintain IRS compliance for per diem and reimbursement tax treatment.

**Late Submission Consequences**:
- Day 15-30: Requires written manager approval with justification
- Day 31+: May be denied; requires Senior Director approval
- Day 60+: Reimbursement will be denied except in extraordinary circumstances

Set a calendar reminder to begin your expense report as soon as you return from travel.

### Expense Reporting System

All expense reports must be submitted through **Concur Expense**:
1. Log in to Concur via the Foundation intranet portal
2. Create a new expense report linked to your pre-approved travel authorization
3. Enter expenses by date, category, and amount
4. Upload required documentation (receipts, folios, boarding passes)
5. Add business justification for expenses that may require explanation
6. Submit for manager approval

### Required Documentation

**Receipts Required**: Itemized receipts are required for all individual expenses of **$25 or more**. Credit card statements are NOT acceptable in place of itemized receipts.

**Hotel Folios**: Complete, itemized hotel folios are mandatory for all lodging expenses, regardless of amount. The folio must show:
- Hotel name and address
- Check-in and check-out dates
- Room rate per night
- Itemized charges (room, taxes, fees)
- Method of payment

**Boarding Passes**: Retain all boarding passes (mobile or paper) for flights. If you used mobile boarding passes that are no longer accessible, provide a screenshot of your flight confirmation or a note in Concur explaining the missing documentation.

**Transportation Receipts**:
- Ride-hailing services (Uber/Ola): Electronic receipt from app
- Taxis: Paper receipt if available, or expense note with pickup/drop-off locations and fare
- Car service: Invoice or receipt from provider

**Missing Receipts**: If a receipt is truly unavailable despite reasonable efforts, provide a detailed explanation in the Concur expense note including date, vendor, business purpose, and reason the receipt is unavailable. Excessive missing receipt claims may require additional approval.

### Flight Class Standards

**International Flights**:
- **Economy class**: Standard for all employees
- **Premium Economy**: Approved for flights over 7 hours or when no economy seats are available. Requires pre-approval from Director level.
- **Business class**: Requires VP-level pre-approval and is typically granted only for medical accommodation or exceptional business circumstances

**Domestic Flights within India**:
- **Economy class only** for all domestic Indian flights
- Business class requires Senior Director approval and is rarely granted (medical reasons only)

**Booking**: All flights must be booked through the Concur Travel portal or Foundation Travel Department. Direct airline bookings will not be reimbursed without pre-authorization.

### Personal Vehicle Mileage

If you use a personal vehicle for Foundation business travel (typically not applicable in India but relevant for US-based travel segments), mileage is reimbursed at the current IRS standard rate of **$0.70 per mile for 2026**.

Document mileage claims in Concur with:
- Date of travel
- Origin and destination addresses
- Odometer start and end readings (or MapQuest/Google Maps distance)
- Business purpose

### Non-Reimbursable Expenses

The following expenses are **NOT reimbursable** under any circumstances:

**Visa and Passport Costs**: The Foundation does not reimburse visa application fees, passport application or renewal fees, passport photos, or expedited processing fees.

**Personal Entertainment**: Movies, hotel pay-per-view, mini-bar charges, spa services, fitness center fees (unless included in hotel rate), or personal entertainment expenses.

**Alcohol**: Foundation policy prohibits reimbursement for alcoholic beverages, even if consumed during business meals.

**Laundry**: Laundry and dry cleaning expenses are not reimbursable for trips under 5 days. For trips of 5 or more consecutive days, reasonable laundry expenses are reimbursable.

**Personal Items**: Toiletries, personal medications, reading materials, or other personal items.

**Traffic Violations**: Parking tickets, speeding tickets, or other traffic fines.

**Upgrades**: Seat upgrades, room upgrades, or vehicle upgrades not pre-approved by the Foundation.

**Travel Insurance**: Individual travel insurance policies (Foundation group policy covers all travelers automatically).

### Currency Conversion

**Concur Exchange Rates**: For expenses paid in Indian Rupees (INR), use Concur's built-in currency conversion feature. Concur automatically applies daily exchange rates from a reputable source.

**Do NOT manually calculate** exchange rates using your credit card statement conversions, which include fees and may not match IRS-approved rates for tax purposes.

**Multiple Currencies**: If your trip involves multiple countries/currencies, separate expenses by currency in Concur. The system will handle conversions appropriately.

### Credit Card Payments

**Foundation Credit Card**: If you have been issued a Foundation credit card for travel, use it for all eligible business expenses. Foundation credit card charges automatically flow into Concur and must be reconciled in your expense report.

**Personal Credit Card**: If you pay with a personal credit card, you will be reimbursed via direct deposit after expense report approval. Reimbursements typically process within 5-7 business days of final approval.

### Per Diem Claims

If you opt for per diem reimbursement instead of actual meal expenses:
- Claim the appropriate M&IE rate for each location (see Section 3)
- Deduct meals provided by hotels, airlines, or meeting hosts (see proportional meal values in Section 3)
- No receipts are required for per diem meal claims
- Remember that first and last travel days are 75% of full M&IE rate

You may mix actual expense reimbursement and per diem on the same trip (e.g., per diem for most days, actual expense for a special business dinner), but you cannot claim both for the same meal.

### Audit and Compliance

The Foundation conducts regular audits of travel expenses. Expense reports may be selected for detailed review. Travelers found to have submitted inaccurate, inflated, or fraudulent expense claims may face:
- Requirement to repay improper expenses
- Disciplinary action up to and including termination
- Referral to legal authorities for significant violations

When in doubt about whether an expense is reimbursable, contact the Finance Department (finance@gatesfoundation.org) or your manager before incurring the expense.

### Geographic Focus Areas

The Foundation's work in India is strategically concentrated in specific states with high development needs and opportunities for large-scale impact.

**Primary Program States**:
- **Bihar**: One of India's poorest and most populous states; focus on maternal and child health, sanitation, and agricultural development
- **Uttar Pradesh**: India's most populous state; focus on health systems strengthening, family planning, and agricultural productivity

**Secondary Program States**:

- **Andhra Pradesh**: Agricultural development and digital financial inclusion pilots
- **Odisha**: Sanitation and hygiene programming
- **Maharashtra**: Urban health systems and partnership with state government

**National-Level Work**: The Foundation also supports national-level policy engagement, research institutions, and partnerships with Government of India ministries (particularly Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture).

### Program Focus Areas

The Foundation's work in India aligns with global strategies while addressing India-specific priorities:

**Global Health**:
- Maternal, newborn, and child health
- Family planning and reproductive health
- Infectious disease control (tuberculosis, malaria, neglected tropical diseases)
- Primary health care strengthening
- Nutrition interventions

**Global Development**:
- Agricultural development and productivity enhancement
- Financial inclusion and digital payments
- Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
- Women's economic empowerment
- Data and evidence for development

**Gender Equality**: Cross-cutting priority integrated across all program areas, with particular focus on women's decision-making power, mobility, and economic opportunity.

### Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) Compliance

**Critical Requirement**: All Foundation activities in India must comply with the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), which regulates receipt and utilization of foreign funding by Indian organizations.

**What This Means for You**:
- The Foundation and our Indian partners operate under strict FCRA licenses and registrations
- All grants, contracts, and financial transactions must be processed through approved FCRA channels
- You may NOT make direct payments to Indian individuals or organizations without prior approval from the Delhi office
- Financial commitments or program activities outside approved FCRA scope can result in serious legal consequences for the Foundation and partners

**When in Doubt**: Contact the India office finance team before making any financial commitments or payments in India.

### Field Visit Coordination

**Mandatory Coordination**: All Foundation staff visiting program field sites in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, or other program states must coordinate with the Delhi office **at least 2 weeks in advance**.

**Coordination Process**:
1. Email your proposed field visit dates, locations, and objectives to the Delhi office
2. Delhi staff will:
   - Arrange Foundation-approved drivers and vehicles
   - Coordinate with local partners for site access and meetings
   - Brief you on security protocols and local context
   - Provide emergency contact information for field areas
   - Arrange interpreter services if needed
3. Confirm all arrangements before booking your Delhi arrival/departure flights

**Why Coordination Is Essential**:
- Security protocols and risk assessment for rural areas
- Relationship management with local partners and communities
- Cultural context and communication support
- Logistical efficiency (combining visits, sharing vehicles)
- Emergency response capabilities

**Unannounced Visits**: Never attempt to visit field sites without Delhi office coordination. Unannounced visits can:
- Strain partner relationships
- Create security risks
- Violate FCRA protocols
- Waste time due to partner unavailability

### Working Across Time Zones

India's time difference from Seattle (12.5-13.5 hours ahead) creates challenges for global team coordination.

**Tips for Effective Collaboration**:
- Schedule calls during overlapping work hours: typically early morning Seattle time or late evening India time
- Use asynchronous communication (email, recorded video updates) for non-urgent matters
- Be realistic about response times; don't expect immediate replies from colleagues in different time zones
- Clearly indicate time zones in all meeting invitations (use "10:00 AM IST" or "10:00 AM Seattle time")
- Use world clock features in Outlook/Google Calendar to avoid scheduling confusion

**Recommended Call Windows**:
- **6:00-9:00 AM Pacific Time** = 6:30-9:30 PM India Standard Time (evening India, morning Seattle)
- **6:00-9:00 PM India Standard Time** = 5:30-8:30 AM Pacific Time (morning Seattle, evening India)

### Cultural Integration

The Delhi office team brings deep expertise in Indian culture, language, government systems, and partner landscapes. Leverage their knowledge:
- Ask for context and background before important meetings
- Request coaching on culturally appropriate communication strategies
- Seek introductions and relationship-building support with new partners
- Defer to local team judgment on government engagement and sensitive issues

Remember that successful Foundation work in India depends on strong, respectful partnerships with Indian colleagues, partners, and government officials. Approach your India engagements with humility, cultural sensitivity, and a commitment to learning.
