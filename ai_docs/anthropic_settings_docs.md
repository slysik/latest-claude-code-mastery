Configuration

Claude Code settings
====================

Copy page

Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Copy page

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL, which opens a tabbed Settings interface where you can view status information and modify configuration options.

[​](#configuration-scopes) Configuration scopes
-----------------------------------------------

Claude Code uses a **scope system** to determine where configurations apply and who they’re shared with. Understanding scopes helps you decide how to configure Claude Code for personal use, team collaboration, or enterprise deployment.

### [​](#available-scopes) Available scopes

| Scope | Location | Who it affects | Shared with team? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Managed** | System-level `managed-settings.json` | All users on the machine | Yes (deployed by IT) |
| **User** | `~/.claude/` directory | You, across all projects | No |
| **Project** | `.claude/` in repository | All collaborators on this repository | Yes (committed to git) |
| **Local** | `.claude/*.local.*` files | You, in this repository only | No (gitignored) |

### [​](#when-to-use-each-scope) When to use each scope

**Managed scope** is for:

* Security policies that must be enforced organization-wide
* Compliance requirements that can’t be overridden
* Standardized configurations deployed by IT/DevOps

**User scope** is best for:

* Personal preferences you want everywhere (themes, editor settings)
* Tools and plugins you use across all projects
* API keys and authentication (stored securely)

**Project scope** is best for:

* Team-shared settings (permissions, hooks, MCP servers)
* Plugins the whole team should have
* Standardizing tooling across collaborators

**Local scope** is best for:

* Personal overrides for a specific project
* Testing configurations before sharing with the team
* Machine-specific settings that won’t work for others

### [​](#how-scopes-interact) How scopes interact

When the same setting is configured in multiple scopes, more specific scopes take precedence:

1. **Managed** (highest) - can’t be overridden by anything
2. **Command line arguments** - temporary session overrides
3. **Local** - overrides project and user settings
4. **Project** - overrides user settings
5. **User** (lowest) - applies when nothing else specifies the setting

For example, if a permission is allowed in user settings but denied in project settings, the project setting takes precedence and the permission is blocked.

### [​](#what-uses-scopes) What uses scopes

Scopes apply to many Claude Code features:

| Feature | User location | Project location | Local location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Settings** | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.local.json` |
| **Subagents** | `~/.claude/agents/` | `.claude/agents/` | — |
| **MCP servers** | `~/.claude.json` | `.mcp.json` | `~/.claude.json` (per-project) |
| **Plugins** | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.local.json` |
| **CLAUDE.md** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.local.md` |

---

[​](#settings-files) Settings files
-----------------------------------

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

* **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
* **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  + `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  + `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
* **Managed settings**: For organizations that need centralized control, Claude Code supports `managed-settings.json` and `managed-mcp.json` files that can be deployed to system directories:
  + macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`
  + Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/`
  + Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\`

  These are system-wide paths (not user home directories like `~/Library/...`) that require administrator privileges. They are designed to be deployed by IT administrators.

  See [Managed settings](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings) and [Managed MCP configuration](/docs/en/mcp#managed-mcp-configuration) for details.

  Managed deployments can also restrict **plugin marketplace additions** using
  `strictKnownMarketplaces`. For more information, see [Managed marketplace restrictions](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions).
* **Other configuration** is stored in `~/.claude.json`. This file contains your preferences (theme, notification settings, editor mode), OAuth session, [MCP server](/docs/en/mcp) configurations for user and local scopes, per-project state (allowed tools, trust settings), and various caches. Project-scoped MCP servers are stored separately in `.mcp.json`.

### [​](#available-settings) Available settings

`settings.json` supports a number of options:

| Key | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiKeyHelper` | Custom script, to be executed in `/bin/sh`, to generate an auth value. This value will be sent as `X-Api-Key` and `Authorization: Bearer` headers for model requests | `/bin/generate_temp_api_key.sh` |
| `cleanupPeriodDays` | Sessions inactive for longer than this period are deleted at startup. Setting to `0` immediately deletes all sessions. (default: 30 days) | `20` |

| `attribution` | Customize attribution for git commits and pull requests. See [Attribution settings](#attribution-settings) | `{"commit": "🤖 Generated with Claude Code", "pr": ""}` |
| `includeCoAuthoredBy` | **Deprecated**: Use `attribution` instead. Whether to include the `co-authored-by Claude` byline in git commits and pull requests (default: `true`) | `false` |
| `permissions` | See table below for structure of permissions. |  |
| `hooks` | Configure custom commands to run before or after tool executions. See [hooks documentation](/docs/en/hooks) | `{"PreToolUse": {"Bash": "echo 'Running command...'"}}` |
| `disableAllHooks` | Disable all [hooks](/docs/en/hooks) | `true` |
| `allowManagedHooksOnly` | (Managed settings only) Prevent loading of user, project, and plugin hooks. Only allows managed hooks and SDK hooks. See [Hook configuration](#hook-configuration) | `true` |
| `model` | Override the default model to use for Claude Code | `"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"` |
| `otelHeadersHelper` | Script to generate dynamic OpenTelemetry headers. Runs at startup and periodically (see [Dynamic headers](/docs/en/monitoring-usage#dynamic-headers)) | `/bin/generate_otel_headers.sh` |
| `statusLine` | Configure a custom status line to display context. See [`statusLine` documentation](/docs/en/statusline) | `{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh"}` |
| `fileSuggestion` | Configure a custom script for `@` file autocomplete. See [File suggestion settings](#file-suggestion-settings) | `{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/file-suggestion.sh"}` |
| `respectGitignore` | Control whether the `@` file picker respects `.gitignore` patterns. When `true` (default), files matching `.gitignore` patterns are excluded from suggestions | `false` |
| `outputStyle` | Configure an output style to adjust the system prompt. See [output styles documentation](/docs/en/output-styles) | `"Explanatory"` |
| `forceLoginMethod` | Use `claudeai` to restrict login to Claude.ai accounts, `console` to restrict login to Claude Console (API usage billing) accounts | `claudeai` |
| `forceLoginOrgUUID` | Specify the UUID of an organization to automatically select it during login, bypassing the organization selection step. Requires `forceLoginMethod` to be set | `"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"` |
| `enableAllProjectMcpServers` | Automatically approve all MCP servers defined in project `.mcp.json` files | `true` |
| `enabledMcpjsonServers` | List of specific MCP servers from `.mcp.json` files to approve | `["memory", "github"]` |
| `disabledMcpjsonServers` | List of specific MCP servers from `.mcp.json` files to reject | `["filesystem"]` |
| `allowedMcpServers` | When set in managed-settings.json, allowlist of MCP servers users can configure. Undefined = no restrictions, empty array = lockdown. Applies to all scopes. Denylist takes precedence. See [Managed MCP configuration](/docs/en/mcp#managed-mcp-configuration) | `[{ "serverName": "github" }]` |
| `deniedMcpServers` | When set in managed-settings.json, denylist of MCP servers that are explicitly blocked. Applies to all scopes including managed servers. Denylist takes precedence over allowlist. See [Managed MCP configuration](/docs/en/mcp#managed-mcp-configuration) | `[{ "serverName": "filesystem" }]` |
| `strictKnownMarketplaces` | When set in managed-settings.json, allowlist of plugin marketplaces users can add. Undefined = no restrictions, empty array = lockdown. Applies to marketplace additions only. See [Managed marketplace restrictions](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions) | `[{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }]` |
| `awsAuthRefresh` | Custom script that modifies the `.aws` directory (see [advanced credential configuration](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock#advanced-credential-configuration)) | `aws sso login --profile myprofile` |

| `language` | Configure Claude’s preferred response language (e.g., `"japanese"`, `"spanish"`, `"french"`). Claude will respond in this language by default | `"japanese"` |

### [​](#permission-settings) Permission settings

| Keys | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allow` | Array of [permission rules](/docs/en/iam#configuring-permissions) to allow tool use. **Note:** Bash rules use prefix matching, not regex | `[ "Bash(git diff:*)" ]` |
| `ask` | Array of [permission rules](/docs/en/iam#configuring-permissions) to ask for confirmation upon tool use. | `[ "Bash(git push:*)" ]` |
| `deny` | Array of [permission rules](/docs/en/iam#configuring-permissions) to deny tool use. Use this to also exclude sensitive files from Claude Code access. **Note:** Bash patterns are prefix matches and can be bypassed (see [Bash permission limitations](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules)) | `[ "WebFetch", "Bash(curl:*)", "Read(./.env)", "Read(./secrets/**)" ]` |
| `additionalDirectories` | Additional [working directories](/docs/en/iam#working-directories) that Claude has access to | `[ "../docs/" ]` |
| `defaultMode` | Default [permission mode](/docs/en/iam#permission-modes) when opening Claude Code | `"acceptEdits"` |
| `disableBypassPermissionsMode` | Set to `"disable"` to prevent `bypassPermissions` mode from being activated. This disables the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` command-line flag. See [managed settings](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings) | `"disable"` |

### [​](#sandbox-settings) Sandbox settings

Configure advanced sandboxing behavior. Sandboxing isolates bash commands from your filesystem and network. See [Sandboxing](/docs/en/sandboxing) for details.
**Filesystem and network restrictions** are configured via Read, Edit, and WebFetch permission rules, not via these sandbox settings.

| Keys | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Enable bash sandboxing (macOS/Linux only). Default: false | `true` |
| `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` | Auto-approve bash commands when sandboxed. Default: true | `true` |
| `excludedCommands` | Commands that should run outside of the sandbox | `["git", "docker"]` |
| `allowUnsandboxedCommands` | Allow commands to run outside the sandbox via the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter. When set to `false`, the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` escape hatch is completely disabled and all commands must run sandboxed (or be in `excludedCommands`). Useful for enterprise policies that require strict sandboxing. Default: true | `false` |
| `network.allowUnixSockets` | Unix socket paths accessible in sandbox (for SSH agents, etc.) | `["~/.ssh/agent-socket"]` |
| `network.allowLocalBinding` | Allow binding to localhost ports (macOS only). Default: false | `true` |
| `network.httpProxyPort` | HTTP proxy port used if you wish to bring your own proxy. If not specified, Claude will run its own proxy. | `8080` |
| `network.socksProxyPort` | SOCKS5 proxy port used if you wish to bring your own proxy. If not specified, Claude will run its own proxy. | `8081` |
| `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` | Enable weaker sandbox for unprivileged Docker environments (Linux only). **Reduces security.** Default: false | `true` |

**Configuration example:**

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": true,
    "excludedCommands": ["docker"],
    "network": {
      "allowUnixSockets": [
        "/var/run/docker.sock"
      ],
      "allowLocalBinding": true
    }
  },
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(.envrc)",
      "Read(~/.aws/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Filesystem and network restrictions** use standard permission rules:

* Use `Read` deny rules to block Claude from reading specific files or directories
* Use `Edit` allow rules to let Claude write to directories beyond the current working directory
* Use `Edit` deny rules to block writes to specific paths
* Use `WebFetch` allow/deny rules to control which network domains Claude can access

### [​](#attribution-settings) Attribution settings

Claude Code adds attribution to git commits and pull requests. These are configured separately:

* Commits use [git trailers](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers) (like `Co-Authored-By`) by default, which can be customized or disabled
* Pull request descriptions are plain text

| Keys | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `commit` | Attribution for git commits, including any trailers. Empty string hides commit attribution |
| `pr` | Attribution for pull request descriptions. Empty string hides pull request attribution |

**Default commit attribution:**

Copy

Ask AI

```
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <[email protected]>
```

**Default pull request attribution:**

Copy

Ask AI

```
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

**Example:**

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "attribution": {
    "commit": "Generated with AI\n\nCo-Authored-By: AI <[email protected]>",
    "pr": ""
  }
}
```

The `attribution` setting takes precedence over the deprecated `includeCoAuthoredBy` setting. To hide all attribution, set `commit` and `pr` to empty strings.

### [​](#file-suggestion-settings) File suggestion settings

Configure a custom command for `@` file path autocomplete. The built-in file suggestion uses fast filesystem traversal, but large monorepos may benefit from project-specific indexing such as a pre-built file index or custom tooling.

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "fileSuggestion": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/file-suggestion.sh"
  }
}
```

The command runs with the same environment variables as [hooks](/docs/en/hooks), including `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. It receives JSON via stdin with a `query` field:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{"query": "src/comp"}
```

Output newline-separated file paths to stdout (currently limited to 15):

Copy

Ask AI

```
src/components/Button.tsx
src/components/Modal.tsx
src/components/Form.tsx
```

**Example:**

Copy

Ask AI

```
#!/bin/bash
query=$(cat | jq -r '.query')
your-repo-file-index --query "$query" | head -20
```

### [​](#hook-configuration) Hook configuration

**Managed settings only**: Controls which hooks are allowed to run. This setting can only be configured in [managed settings](#settings-files) and provides administrators with strict control over hook execution.
**Behavior when `allowManagedHooksOnly` is `true`:**

* Managed hooks and SDK hooks are loaded
* User hooks, project hooks, and plugin hooks are blocked

**Configuration:**

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "allowManagedHooksOnly": true
}
```

### [​](#settings-precedence) Settings precedence

Settings apply in order of precedence. From highest to lowest:

1. **Managed settings** (`managed-settings.json`)
   * Policies deployed by IT/DevOps to system directories
   * Cannot be overridden by user or project settings
2. **Command line arguments**
   * Temporary overrides for a specific session
3. **Local project settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
   * Personal project-specific settings
4. **Shared project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`)
   * Team-shared project settings in source control
5. **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
   * Personal global settings

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing teams and individuals to customize their experience.
For example, if your user settings allow `Bash(npm run:*)` but a project’s shared settings deny it, the project setting takes precedence and the command is blocked.

### [​](#key-points-about-the-configuration-system) Key points about the configuration system

* **Memory files (`CLAUDE.md`)**: Contain instructions and context that Claude loads at startup
* **Settings files (JSON)**: Configure permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior
* **Slash commands**: Custom commands that can be invoked during a session with `/command-name`
* **MCP servers**: Extend Claude Code with additional tools and integrations
* **Precedence**: Higher-level configurations (Managed) override lower-level ones (User/Project)
* **Inheritance**: Settings are merged, with more specific settings adding to or overriding broader ones

### [​](#system-prompt) System prompt

Claude Code’s internal system prompt is not published. To add custom instructions, use `CLAUDE.md` files or the `--append-system-prompt` flag.

### [​](#excluding-sensitive-files) Excluding sensitive files

To prevent Claude Code from accessing files containing sensitive information like API keys, secrets, and environment files, use the `permissions.deny` setting in your `.claude/settings.json` file:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Read(./config/credentials.json)",
      "Read(./build)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This replaces the deprecated `ignorePatterns` configuration. Files matching these patterns will be completely invisible to Claude Code, preventing any accidental exposure of sensitive data.

[​](#subagent-configuration) Subagent configuration
---------------------------------------------------

Claude Code supports custom AI subagents that can be configured at both user and project levels. These subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

* **User subagents**: `~/.claude/agents/` - Available across all your projects
* **Project subagents**: `.claude/agents/` - Specific to your project and can be shared with your team

Subagent files define specialized AI assistants with custom prompts and tool permissions. Learn more about creating and using subagents in the [subagents documentation](/docs/en/sub-agents).

[​](#plugin-configuration) Plugin configuration
-----------------------------------------------

Claude Code supports a plugin system that lets you extend functionality with custom commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugins are distributed through marketplaces and can be configured at both user and repository levels.

### [​](#plugin-settings) Plugin settings

Plugin-related settings in `settings.json`:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "formatter@acme-tools": true,
    "deployer@acme-tools": true,
    "analyzer@security-plugins": false
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
    }
  }
}
```

#### [​](#enabledplugins) `enabledPlugins`

Controls which plugins are enabled. Format: `"plugin-name@marketplace-name": true/false`
**Scopes**:

* **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`): Personal plugin preferences
* **Project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`): Project-specific plugins shared with team
* **Local settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`): Per-machine overrides (not committed)

**Example**:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "code-formatter@team-tools": true,
    "deployment-tools@team-tools": true,
    "experimental-features@personal": false
  }
}
```

#### [​](#extraknownmarketplaces) `extraKnownMarketplaces`

Defines additional marketplaces that should be made available for the repository. Typically used in repository-level settings to ensure team members have access to required plugin sources.
**When a repository includes `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

1. Team members are prompted to install the marketplace when they trust the folder
2. Team members are then prompted to install plugins from that marketplace
3. Users can skip unwanted marketplaces or plugins (stored in user settings)
4. Installation respects trust boundaries and requires explicit consent

**Example**:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
      }
    },
    "security-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "git",
        "url": "https://git.example.com/security/plugins.git"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Marketplace source types**:

* `github`: GitHub repository (uses `repo`)
* `git`: Any git URL (uses `url`)
* `directory`: Local filesystem path (uses `path`, for development only)

#### [​](#strictknownmarketplaces) `strictKnownMarketplaces`

**Managed settings only**: Controls which plugin marketplaces users are allowed to add. This setting can only be configured in [`managed-settings.json`](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings) and provides administrators with strict control over marketplace sources.
**Managed settings file locations**:

* **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
* **Linux and WSL**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
* **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`

**Key characteristics**:

* Only available in managed settings (`managed-settings.json`)
* Cannot be overridden by user or project settings (highest precedence)
* Enforced BEFORE network/filesystem operations (blocked sources never execute)
* Uses exact matching for source specifications (including `ref`, `path` for git sources)

**Allowlist behavior**:

* `undefined` (default): No restrictions - users can add any marketplace
* Empty array `[]`: Complete lockdown - users cannot add any new marketplaces
* List of sources: Users can only add marketplaces that match exactly

**All supported source types**:
The allowlist supports six marketplace source types. Each source must match exactly for a user’s marketplace addition to be allowed.

1. **GitHub repositories**:

URL-based marketplaces only download the `marketplace.json` file. They do not download plugin files from the server. Plugins in URL-based marketplaces must use external sources (GitHub, npm, or git URLs) rather than relative paths. For plugins with relative paths, use a Git-based marketplace instead. See [Troubleshooting](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#plugins-with-relative-paths-fail-in-url-based-marketplaces) for details.

**Configuration examples**:
Example - Allow specific marketplaces only:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins"
    },
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools",
      "ref": "v2.0"
    },
    {
      "source": "url",
      "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json"
    },
    {
      "source": "npm",
      "package": "@acme-corp/compliance-plugins"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example - Disable all marketplace additions:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": []
}
```

**Exact matching requirements**:
Marketplace sources must match **exactly** for a user’s addition to be allowed. For git-based sources (`github` and `git`), this includes all optional fields:

* The `repo` or `url` must match exactly
* The `ref` field must match exactly (or both be undefined)
* The `path` field must match exactly (or both be undefined)

Examples of sources that **do NOT match**:

Copy

Ask AI

```
// These are DIFFERENT sources:
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main" }

// These are also DIFFERENT:
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "path": "marketplace" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
```

**Comparison with `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

| Aspect | `strictKnownMarketplaces` | `extraKnownMarketplaces` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Organizational policy enforcement | Team convenience |
| **Settings file** | `managed-settings.json` only | Any settings file |
| **Behavior** | Blocks non-allowlisted additions | Auto-installs missing marketplaces |
| **When enforced** | Before network/filesystem operations | After user trust prompt |
| **Can be overridden** | No (highest precedence) | Yes (by higher precedence settings) |
| **Source format** | Direct source object | Named marketplace with nested source |
| **Use case** | Compliance, security restrictions | Onboarding, standardization |

**Format difference**:
`strictKnownMarketplaces` uses direct source objects:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
  ]
}
```

`extraKnownMarketplaces` requires named marketplaces:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important notes**:

* Restrictions are checked BEFORE any network requests or filesystem operations
* When blocked, users see clear error messages indicating the source is blocked by managed policy
* The restriction applies only to adding NEW marketplaces; previously installed marketplaces remain accessible
* Managed settings have the highest precedence and cannot be overridden

See [Managed marketplace restrictions](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions) for user-facing documentation.

### [​](#managing-plugins) Managing plugins

Use the `/plugin` command to manage plugins interactively:

* Browse available plugins from marketplaces
* Install/uninstall plugins
* Enable/disable plugins
* View plugin details (commands, agents, hooks provided)
* Add/remove marketplaces

Learn more about the plugin system in the [plugins documentation](/docs/en/plugins).

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](/docs/en/settings#available-settings). Also see [Tool-specific permission rules](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules).

### [​](#bash-tool-behavior) Bash tool behavior

The Bash tool executes shell commands with the following persistence behavior:

* **Working directory persists**: When Claude changes the working directory (for example, `cd /path/to/dir`), subsequent Bash commands will execute in that directory. You can use `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1` to reset to the project directory after each command.
* **Environment variables do NOT persist**: Environment variables set in one Bash command (for example, `export MY_VAR=value`) are **not** available in subsequent Bash commands. Each Bash command runs in a fresh shell environment.

To make environment variables available in Bash commands, you have **three options**:
**Option 1: Activate environment before starting Claude Code** (simplest approach)
Activate your virtual environment in your terminal before launching Claude Code:

Copy

Ask AI

```
conda activate myenv
# or: source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
claude
```

This works for shell environments but environment variables set within Claude’s Bash commands will not persist between commands.
**Option 2: Set CLAUDE\_ENV\_FILE before starting Claude Code** (persistent environment setup)
Export the path to a shell script containing your environment setup:

Copy

Ask AI

```
export CLAUDE_ENV_FILE=/path/to/env-setup.sh
claude
```

Where `/path/to/env-setup.sh` contains:

Copy

Ask AI

```
conda activate myenv
# or: source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
# or: export MY_VAR=value
```

Claude Code will source this file before each Bash command, making the environment persistent across all commands.
**Option 3: Use a SessionStart hook** (project-specific configuration)
Configure in `.claude/settings.json`:

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "startup",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo 'conda activate myenv' >> \"$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE\""
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

The hook writes to `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`, which is then sourced before each Bash command. This is ideal for team-shared project configurations.
See [SessionStart hooks](/docs/en/hooks#persisting-environment-variables) for more details on Option 3.

### [​](#extending-tools-with-hooks) Extending tools with hooks

You can run custom commands before or after any tool executes using
[Claude Code hooks](/docs/en/hooks-guide).
For example, you could automatically run a Python formatter after Claude
modifies Python files, or prevent modifications to production configuration
files by blocking Write operations to certain paths.
