[​](#custom-slash-commands) Custom slash commands
-------------------------------------------------

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

Slash command autocomplete works anywhere in your input, not just at the beginning. Type `/` at any position to see available commands.

### [​](#syntax) Syntax

Copy

Ask AI

```
/<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### [​](#parameters) Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension) |
| `[arguments]` | Optional arguments passed to the command |

### [​](#command-types) Command types

#### [​](#project-commands) Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team. When listed in `/help`, these commands show “(project)” after their description.
**Location**: `.claude/commands/`
The following example creates the `/optimize` command:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### [​](#personal-commands) Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects. When listed in `/help`, these commands show “(user)” after their description.
**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`
The following example creates the `/security-review` command:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### [​](#features) Features

#### [​](#namespacing) Namespacing

Use subdirectories to group related commands. Subdirectories appear in the command description but don’t affect the command name.
For example:

* `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates `/component` with description “(project:frontend)”
* `~/.claude/commands/component.md` creates `/component` with description “(user)”

If a project command and user command share the same name, the project command takes precedence and the user command is silently ignored. For example, if both `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and `~/.claude/commands/deploy.md` exist, `/deploy` runs the project version.
Commands in different subdirectories can share names since the subdirectory appears in the description to distinguish them. For example, `.claude/commands/frontend/test.md` and `.claude/commands/backend/test.md` both create `/test`, but show as “(project:frontend)” and “(project:backend)” respectively.

#### [​](#arguments) Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using argument placeholders:

##### All arguments with `$ARGUMENTS`

The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures all arguments passed to the command:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /fix-issue 123 high-priority
# $ARGUMENTS becomes: "123 high-priority"
```

##### Individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, etc.

Access specific arguments individually using positional parameters (similar to shell scripts):

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Command definition  
echo 'Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3' > .claude/commands/review-pr.md

# Usage
> /review-pr 456 high alice
# $1 becomes "456", $2 becomes "high", $3 becomes "alice"
```

Use positional arguments when you need to:

* Access arguments individually in different parts of your command
* Provide defaults for missing arguments
* Build more structured commands with specific parameter roles

#### [​](#bash-command-execution) Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context. You *must* include `allowed-tools` with the `Bash` tool, but you can choose the specific bash commands to allow.
For example:

Copy

Ask AI

```
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### [​](#file-references) File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/docs/en/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).
For example:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Reference a specific file

Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files

Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### [​](#thinking-mode) Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/docs/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### [​](#frontmatter) Frontmatter

Command files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the command:

| Frontmatter | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed-tools` | List of tools the command can use | Inherits from the conversation |
| `argument-hint` | The arguments expected for the slash command. Example: `argument-hint: add [tagId] | remove [tagId] | list`. This hint is shown to the user when auto-completing the slash command. | None |
| `context` | Set to `fork` to run the command in a forked sub-agent context with its own conversation history. | Inline (no fork) |
| `agent` | Specify which [agent type](/docs/en/sub-agents#built-in-subagents) to use when `context: fork` is set. Only applicable when combined with `context: fork`. | `general-purpose` |
| `description` | Brief description of the command | Uses the first line from the prompt |
| `model` | Specific model string (see [Models overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview)) | Inherits from the conversation |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Whether to prevent the `Skill` tool from calling this command | false |
| `hooks` | Define hooks scoped to this command’s execution. See [Define hooks for commands](#define-hooks-for-commands). | None |

For example:

Copy

Ask AI

```
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
argument-hint: [message]
description: Create a git commit
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
---

Create a git commit with message: $ARGUMENTS
```

Example using positional arguments:

Copy

Ask AI

```
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
Focus on security, performance, and code style.
```

#### [​](#define-hooks-for-commands) Define hooks for commands

Slash commands can define hooks that run during the command’s execution. Use the `hooks` field to specify `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, or `Stop` handlers:

Copy

Ask AI

```
---
description: Deploy to staging with validation
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-deploy.sh"
          once: true
---

Deploy the current branch to staging environment.
```

The `once: true` option runs the hook only once per session. After the first successful execution, the hook is removed.
Hooks defined in a command are scoped to that command’s execution and are automatically cleaned up when the command finishes.
See [Hooks](/docs/en/hooks) for the complete hook configuration format.

[​](#plugin-commands) Plugin commands
-------------------------------------

[Plugins](/docs/en/plugins) can provide custom slash commands that integrate seamlessly with Claude Code. Plugin commands work exactly like user-defined commands but are distributed through [plugin marketplaces](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### [​](#how-plugin-commands-work) How plugin commands work

Plugin commands are:

* **Namespaced**: Commands can use the format `/plugin-name:command-name` to avoid conflicts (plugin prefix is optional unless there are name collisions)
* **Automatically available**: Once a plugin is installed and enabled, its commands appear in `/help`
* **Fully integrated**: Support all command features (arguments, frontmatter, bash execution, file references)

### [​](#plugin-command-structure) Plugin command structure

**Location**: `commands/` directory in plugin root
**File format**: Markdown files with frontmatter
**Basic command structure**:

Copy

Ask AI

```
---
description: Brief description of what the command does
---

# Command Name

Detailed instructions for Claude on how to execute this command.
Include specific guidance on parameters, expected outcomes, and any special considerations.
```

**Advanced command features**:

* **Arguments**: Use placeholders like `{arg1}` in command descriptions
* **Subdirectories**: Organize commands in subdirectories for namespacing
* **Bash integration**: Commands can execute shell scripts and programs
* **File references**: Commands can reference and modify project files

### [​](#invocation-patterns) Invocation patterns

Direct command (when no conflicts)

Copy

Ask AI

```
/command-name
```

Plugin-prefixed (when needed for disambiguation)

Copy

Ask AI

```
/plugin-name:command-name
```

With arguments (if command supports them)

Copy

Ask AI

```
/command-name arg1 arg2
```

[​](#mcp-slash-commands) MCP slash commands
-------------------------------------------

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### [​](#command-format) Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:

Copy

Ask AI

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

### [​](#features-2) Features

#### [​](#dynamic-discovery) Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

* An MCP server is connected and active
* The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
* The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### [​](#arguments-2) Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Without arguments
> /mcp__github__list_prs

# With arguments
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

#### [​](#naming-conventions) Naming conventions

Server and prompt names are normalized:

* Spaces and special characters become underscores
* Names are lowercase for consistency

### [​](#managing-mcp-connections) Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

* View all configured MCP servers
* Check connection status
* Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
* Clear authentication tokens
* View available tools and prompts from each server

### [​](#mcp-permissions-and-wildcards) MCP permissions and wildcards

To approve all tools from an MCP server, use either the server name alone or wildcard syntax:

* `mcp__github` (approves all GitHub tools)
* `mcp__github__*` (wildcard syntax, also approves all GitHub tools)

To approve specific tools, list each one explicitly:

* `mcp__github__get_issue`
* `mcp__github__list_issues`

See [MCP permission rules](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) for more details.

[​](#skill-tool) `Skill` tool
-----------------------------

In earlier versions of Claude Code, slash command invocation was provided by a separate `SlashCommand` tool. This has been merged into the `Skill` tool.

The `Skill` tool allows Claude to programmatically invoke both [custom slash commands](/docs/en/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) and [Agent Skills](/docs/en/skills) during a conversation. This gives Claude the ability to use these capabilities on your behalf when appropriate.

### [​](#what-the-skill-tool-can-invoke) What the `Skill` tool can invoke

The `Skill` tool provides access to:

| Type | Location | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom slash commands | `.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/commands/` | Must have `description` frontmatter |
| Agent Skills | `.claude/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/` | Must not have `disable-model-invocation: true` |

Built-in commands like `/compact` and `/init` are *not* available through this tool.

### [​](#encourage-claude-to-use-specific-commands) Encourage Claude to use specific commands

To encourage Claude to use the `Skill` tool, reference the command by name, including the slash, in your prompts or `CLAUDE.md` file:

Copy

Ask AI

```
> Run /write-unit-test when you are about to start writing tests.
```

This tool puts each available command’s metadata into context up to the character budget limit. Use `/context` to monitor token usage.
To see which commands and Skills are available to the `Skill` tool, run `claude --debug` and trigger a query.

### [​](#disable-the-skill-tool) Disable the `Skill` tool

To prevent Claude from programmatically invoking any commands or Skills:

Copy

Ask AI

```
/permissions
# Add to deny rules: Skill
```

This removes the `Skill` tool and all command/Skill descriptions from context.

### [​](#disable-specific-commands-or-skills) Disable specific commands or Skills

To prevent a specific command or Skill from being invoked programmatically via the `Skill` tool, add `disable-model-invocation: true` to its frontmatter. This also removes the item’s metadata from context.

The `user-invocable` field in Skills only controls menu visibility, not `Skill` tool access. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` to block programmatic invocation. See [Control Skill visibility](/docs/en/skills#control-skill-visibility) for details.

### [​](#skill-permission-rules) `Skill` permission rules

The permission rules support:

* **Exact match**: `Skill(commit)` (allows only `commit` with no arguments)
* **Prefix match**: `Skill(review-pr:*)` (allows `review-pr` with any arguments)

### [​](#character-budget-limit) Character budget limit

The `Skill` tool includes a character budget to limit context usage. This prevents token overflow when many commands and Skills are available.
The budget includes each item’s name, arguments, and description.

* **Default limit**: 15,000 characters
* **Custom limit**: Set via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable. The name is retained for backwards compatibility.

When the budget is exceeded, Claude sees only a subset of available items. In `/context`, a warning shows how many are included.

[​](#skills-vs-slash-commands) Skills vs slash commands
-------------------------------------------------------

**Slash commands** and **Agent Skills** serve different purposes in Claude Code:

### [​](#use-slash-commands-for) Use slash commands for

**Quick, frequently used prompts**:

* Simple prompt snippets you use often
* Quick reminders or templates
* Frequently used instructions that fit in one file

**Examples**:

* `/review` → “Review this code for bugs and suggest improvements”
* `/explain` → “Explain this code in simple terms”
* `/optimize` → “Analyze this code for performance issues”

### [​](#use-skills-for) Use Skills for

**Comprehensive capabilities with structure**:

* Complex workflows with multiple steps
* Capabilities requiring scripts or utilities
* Knowledge organized across multiple files
* Team workflows you want to standardize

**Examples**:

* PDF processing Skill with form-filling scripts and validation
* Data analysis Skill with reference docs for different data types
* Documentation Skill with style guides and templates

### [​](#key-differences) Key differences

| Aspect | Slash Commands | Agent Skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Complexity** | Simple prompts | Complex capabilities |
| **Structure** | Single .md file | Directory with SKILL.md + resources |
| **Discovery** | Explicit invocation (`/command`) | Automatic (based on context) |
| **Files** | One file only | Multiple files, scripts, templates |
| **Scope** | Project or personal | Project or personal |
| **Sharing** | Via git | Via git |

### [​](#example-comparison) Example comparison

**As a slash command**:

Copy

Ask AI

```
# .claude/commands/review.md
Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations
```

Usage: `/review` (manual invocation)
**As a Skill**:

Copy

Ask AI

```
.claude/skills/code-review/
├── SKILL.md (overview and workflows)
├── SECURITY.md (security checklist)
├── PERFORMANCE.md (performance patterns)
├── STYLE.md (style guide reference)
└── scripts/
    └── run-linters.sh
```

Usage: “Can you review this code?” (automatic discovery)
The Skill provides richer context, validation scripts, and organized reference material.

### [​](#when-to-use-each) When to use each

**Use slash commands**:

* You invoke the same prompt repeatedly
* The prompt fits in a single file
* You want explicit control over when it runs

**Use Skills**:

* Claude should discover the capability automatically
* Multiple files or scripts are needed
* Complex workflows with validation steps
* Team needs standardized, detailed guidance

Both slash commands and Skills can coexist. Use the approach that fits your needs.
